## About
The Wurst Hack Client for Minecraft is packed full of the latest and most exciting mods, commands and other features. It contains over 70 mods and over 20 commands that let you rule the game.

## Compiling
Compiling the Wurst Client with this source code is not yet possible due to Minecraft's closed-source policy.
But I'm working on it...
