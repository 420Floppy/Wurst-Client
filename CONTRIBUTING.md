# General rules
## Rules of conduct
1. Do not insult others.
2. Do not overreact.
3. Do not spam.

## Grammar & Markdown
1. **Make sure to use proper grammar**  
If no one can read it, no one can help you.
2. **Make sure to use proper Markdown**  
Markdown can make your text look very pretty, but if you don't use it correctly, it will make your text look very messy. If you have never worked with Markdown before, GitHub has a simple [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) where you can learn Markdown in only 3 minutes.
3. **Use emojis**  
Emojis are awesome! :octocat: :space_invader: :trollface: A full list of emojis can be found [here](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).

# Issues
## When to use Issues
### Use Issues to:
- report a **bug**
- make a **suggestion** (e.g. an idea for a new feature)
- ask a **question** or request **help**

### Do NOT use Issues to:
- comment on another Issue (use comments instead)

## How many Issues to use
>In the following paragraph, "GitHub Issue" means an entry in the GitHub Issue tracker and "issue" means a bug, suggestion, question or other problem.

Every GitHub Issue must be about **one** issue. No more, no less! If you have multiple issues, open a new GitHub Issue for each of them (and I don't care if that  means opening five GitHub Issues at once).
