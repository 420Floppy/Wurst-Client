# General rules
## Rules of conduct
1. **Do not insult others.**  
GitHub is a very friendly place, so please let it stay one.
2. **Do not overreact.**  
Don't be offended if your Issue or your Pull Request gets rejected.
3. **Do not spam.**  
There are better ways to spend your time.

## Grammar & Markdown
1. **Make sure to use proper grammar**  
If no one can read it, no one can help you.
2. **Make sure to use proper Markdown**  
Markdown can make your text look very pretty, but if you don't use it correctly, it will make your text look very messy. See [below](#tutorials) for a Markdown tutorial.
3. **Use emojis from time to time**  
Emojis are awesome! :octocat: :space_invader: :trollface: A full list of emojis can be found [here](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).

# Issues
## One Issue per issue
Every GitHub Issue must be about **one** issue. No more, no less! If you have multiple issues, open a new GitHub Issue for each of them (even if that  means opening five GitHub Issues at once).

## Tips
>Tips with :heart: by [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)

- **Check existing issues** for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running into has been addressed already.
- **Be clear** about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
- **Include system details** like what the browser, library or operating system you’re using and its version.
- **Paste error output** or logs in your issue or in a Gist. If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks so that it renders nicely.

# Pull Requests
## Tips
>Tips with :heart: by [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)

- **Fork the repository** and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original "upstream" repository by adding it as a remote. **Pull in changes** from "upstream" often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. See more detailed instructions here.
Create a branch for your edits.
- **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
- **It’s best to test.** Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
- **Include screenshots** of the before and after if your changes include visible differences. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
- **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
